Creating new django models (tables). In order to use it in code, change the ownership of the table to the -U postgres. 
Go to the postgres server and execute query: 
"ALTER TABLE table_name public."table_name" OWNER to postgres;
"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON django_trader TO postgres"

1. IMPORTANT!!! if there are any caps or spaces, the table MUST be enclosed in double quotes!!!!
